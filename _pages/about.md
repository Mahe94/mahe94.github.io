I'm a <b>Post-Doctoral Fellow</b> at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. I'm currently working in the area of public-key cryptography and quantum cryptography under the guidance of <a href='https://web.iitd.ac.in/~kvenkata/'>Prof. Venkata Koppula</a> and <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~rishab/">Prof. Rishab Goyal</a>.

I completed my PhD and MTech degree under the guidance of <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/manindra/home'>Prof. Manindra Agrawal</a> at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. During that time, I was actively working on the cryptanalysis of symmetric-key cryptosystems and variants of subset-sum problem.

My <i>Erd<span>&#337;</span>s</i> number is 4 (Me -> <a href='https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/skmehta/'>Shashank K. Mehta</a> -> Jitender S. Deogun -> Zsolt Tuza -> Paul Erd<span>&#337;</span>s).
