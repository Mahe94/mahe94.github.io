I'm currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. My research interest lies in the world of public-key cryptography and quantum cryptography.

I completed my PhD and MTech degree under the guidance of Prof. Manindra Agrawal at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. During that time, I was actively working on the cryptanalysis of symmetric-key cryptosystems and variants of subset-sum problem.
