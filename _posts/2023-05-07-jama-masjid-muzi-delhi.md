**Introduction:**
In this blog post, I'll share the delightful day I spent with my friend Muzafar in Delhi. He had a layover in the city while traveling back to Kanpur from a conference in Bangalore. We made the most of his short stay by exploring local cuisine and enjoying each other's company. Join me as I recount our food-filled adventure.

**Disappoint Muzafar:**
Muzafar arrived in Delhi early in the morning and took some time to rest before our exciting day began. We started off with breakfast at a nearby restaurant called Burger.in, indulging in a burgers and sandwiches. Unfortunately, Muzafar wasn't particularly fond of the food there, but it didn't dampen our spirits.

**Lunch at Jama Masjid:**
After returning to the room and catching up on each other's lives, we decided to head to Jama Masjid for lunch. We first went to the New Delhi Railway Station (NDLS) to store Muzafar's luggage in the cloakroom, ensuring a hassle-free outing. Taking an auto rickshaw, we made our way to Jama Masjid.

**Not-So-Delightful Kashmiri Cuisine:**
At Jama Masjid, we discovered a Kashmiri restaurant and decided to try some traditional dishes. We ordered yahni and rista, hoping to savor the authentic flavors of Kashmir. However, the taste didn't quite match our expectations. Nevertheless, we appreciated the experience and savored the time spent together.

**Exploring Jama Masjid:**
Following our satisfying meal, we visited the iconic Jama Masjid mosque. Muzafar took the opportunity to offer his prayers while I admired the architectural beauty of the mosque. We also captured some memorable pictures, cherishing the moments we shared. Our next stop was a shoe showroom, where I tried on some running shoes, exploring options for my own needs.

**Farewell and Fond Memories:**
As the day drew to a close, we bid each other farewell, knowing that our time together had been filled with laughter and good food. Sharing a meal with Muzafar is always a delightful experience, and this day in Delhi was no exception. As I reflected on our time together, I couldn't help but feel grateful for our friendship and the memories we had created.
