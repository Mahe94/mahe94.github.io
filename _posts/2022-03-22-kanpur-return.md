**Introduction:**
As we mark the two-year anniversary since the outbreak of COVID-19 and the subsequent evacuation of students from their campuses, IIT Kanpur has finally reopened its doors, signaling a return to normalcy. Personally, it meant bidding farewell to the comforts of home and embarking on a journey back to Kanpur. Little did I know that this journey would be filled with unexpected surprises, both delightful and challenging.

**An Unexpected Encounter:**
At the airport, en route to Kanpur with a layover in Bangalore, fate had a special encounter in store for me. Among the crowd of travelers stood Shobana, the magnificent actress renowned for her portrayal of Nagavalli. I couldn't resist the opportunity to approach her with my iPad, seeking her autograph. To my delight, she graciously obliged and even complimented my choice of gadget. Though I understood her reluctance to take a photograph due to the prevailing COVID precautions, this encounter made the first half of my day truly memorable.

**A Shift in Accommodation:**
However, as the day progressed, a less pleasant task awaited me. It was notified to me that my former hostel room, D-218, in Hall 4, had been converted into a girls' hostel. Consequently, I had to vacate the room and find new accommodations. With the help of my friends, I managed to transport all my belongings to my new room, J-210, located in Hall 7. Despite the inconvenience, I saw this transition as an opportunity for a fresh start, especially as I embarked on my PhD journey.
