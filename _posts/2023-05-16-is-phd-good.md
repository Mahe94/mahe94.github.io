**Introduction:**
While having my breakfast at the ICH canteen in IIT Delhi, I had an unexpected encounter with a PhD student from the CSE department who was nearing the completion his degree. Our conversation shed light on the arduous path we both had traversed during our respective doctoral journeys. Little did I know that his story would uncover the harsh realities faced by PhD students, leaving me pondering the complexities and uncertainties that lie within this academic pursuit.

**A Shared Struggle:**
As we sat down for breakfast, I recognized this student from the times he sought solace in my lab for his online meetings. Our discussion naturally gravitated towards our experiences in pursuing a PhD, and I soon realized that his struggles mirrored my own. It took him a staggering eight years to complete his doctoral studies, having previously obtained an M.Tech from IIT Delhi. Comparatively, my own journey encompassed five years of PhD research and a two-year M.Tech program.

**The Unfortunate Encounter:**
It was during this conversation that he unveiled a distressing truth about his PhD experienceâ€”an abusive advisor. He had taken the courageous step of lodging a formal complaint with the department, hoping for a resolution. However, the unfortunate reality was that his advisor's seniority shielded him from any repercussions. To his dismay, his complaint appeared to have backfired, resulting in his advisor refusing to sign his thesis. In a final blow, even the Head of the Department declined to provide the necessary signature. Nonetheless, he remained undeterred, drawing strength from the supportive faculty members who rallied behind him. With their assistance, he made the difficult decision to submit his thesis without the signatures, determined to see his hard work acknowledged.

**Reflecting on the PhD Experience:**
The encounter left me questioning the prevalent animosity often directed towards PhD students. Why do some supervisors perceive their guidance as a favor rather than a responsibility? If they lack interest in mentoring, why do they fail to communicate this clearly? These questions gnaw at my thoughts, as I consider the profound impact these experiences can have on an individual's academic and personal life. One can't help but wonder if pursuing a PhD is a viable choice when the landscape can change so unpredictably. The supportive mentor of today may transform into an adversary tomorrow, leaving students in a state of profound confusion.

**The Perplexing Dilemma:**
As I conclude this encounter with the PhD student, I find myself grappling with the responsibility of advising others on whether to embark on this academic journey. How can one confidently steer someone towards or away from a PhD when the terrain is fraught with uncertainty? The realization that people are capable of change further deepens the dilemma, blurring the line between guidance and disillusionment.
