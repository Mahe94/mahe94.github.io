**Introduction:**
In this blog post, I'll take you through the exciting journey I had with my friends in Gwalior. It all started when my *online* PhD Oral Defense allowed me to skip a trip back to Kanpur. So, my labmates and I decided to make the most of the opportunity and plan a trip to Gwalior, a city known for its rich history and architectural wonders. From unexpected encounters to breathtaking sights, here's a detailed account of our unforgettable adventure.

**Heading to Gwalior:**
With Prateek already in Delhi attending a cousin's wedding in Uttarakhand, Bhargav, Muzafar, and I embarked on our journey from Kanpur. We booked our bus tickets to Gwalior, and my bus started from Kashmere Gate, which was just a 25-minute metro ride away from Hauz Khas. However, Prateek couldn't locate the bus at Akshardham metro station. Determined to find him, I quickly left the bus without even putting on my shoes, which led to a humorous encounter with the bus conductor.

**Exploring Gwalior:**
After overcoming the shoe mishap and reuniting with Prateek, our adventure began in full swing. We reached Gwalior around 6 AM, in front of DB mall, conveniently close to our hotel, Shri Vidhichand Dharmashala. Freshening up, we decided to rent two scooters to explore the city. Although collecting the scooters turned out to be a bit of a hassle, our spirits remained high as we indulged in a delightful breakfast of poha-jalebi from Panwadi Poha Center, a highly recommended local eatery.

Our first destination was the magnificent Tomb of Mohammed Ghaus & Tansen. With a slight detour due to misleading directions from Google Maps, we sought help from locals to guide us to this remarkable landmark. After spending quality time at the tomb, we planned to visit the sun temple, only to discover it was closed for renovations.

Undeterred by this setback, we returned to our hotel to escape the scorching heat and take a quick nap. Around 2 PM, we had to switch rooms due to some confusion but managed to settle in comfortably. For lunch, we headed to Kwality restaurant, where Muzafar and I indulged in mouthwatering dishes like chicken lollipop, chicken biryani, kulcha, and mutton rogan gosh. Energized by the delicious meal, we proceeded to explore Jai Vilas Palace, a grand structure belonging to the Scindia family. Unfortunately, photography was not allowed inside the museum, but the opulent interiors left an indelible impression on us.

**Unforgettable Moments:**
As the day progressed, we stopped by the Indian Coffee House for a refreshing cold coffee treat with ice cream. Later, we ventured to the Gwalior fort to watch a light and sound show, which, much to our disappointment, was canceled due to COVID restrictions. Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed our uphill journey to the fort, despite a minor scooter mishap. We made our way back to DB mall, returned the scooters, and met Muzafar for dinner at KFC.

**A Day at Gwalior Fort:**
On the following day, we embarked on an early morning trek to Gwalior Fort, starting from a different location than our previous scooter adventure. The trek was exhilarating, and reaching the top, we entered Man Singh Palace, a beautiful structure adorned with vibrant blue tiles. The palace's courtyard offered a serene setting to immerse ourselves in history. Afterward, we relished a hot bowl of Maggi for breakfast before visiting the stunning Sasbahu Temple, which provided a panoramic view of Gwalior Fort and the city.

Our exploration continued with visits to Teli Ka Mandir, followed by a downhill walk where we encountered awe-inspiring Jain statues adorning the mountain walls. The journey continued to Gopachal Parvat, where we took an auto rickshaw. As Muzafar grew tired, he decided to return to the hotel, while Prateek, Bhargav, and I trekked barefoot uphill to a Jain temple. The scorching ground compelled us to seek shade and cool our soles, but upon reaching the top, the sight of partially destroyed Jain statues left us awestruck.

**Relaxation and Farewell:**
Returning to the hotel, we visited India Coffee House for refreshments, and later enjoyed a vegetarian thali, khichdi, roti, and paneer at a nearby restaurant. Our sightseeing continued with a visit to a cricket stadium, which turned out to be closed. As our journey back home approached, we opted for a light dinner at a kachori eatery before purchasing bananas and juice from DB mall. Finally, my friends bid me farewell at 8:30 PM, while I eagerly awaited my bus at 9:30 PM, cherishing the memories created during this incredible trip.

**Conclusion:**
My trip to Gwalior was filled with laughter, unexpected moments, and awe-inspiring sights. From exploring historical monuments to savoring delicious local cuisine, every experience was truly unforgettable. Gwalior's rich heritage and warm hospitality left a lasting impression on me. I can't wait to plan my next adventure and create more cherished memories.
